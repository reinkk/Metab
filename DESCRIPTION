Description: Metab automates routine tasks performed in metabolomics.
        In addition, it performs statistical hypothesis test (t-test)
        and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Furthermore, Metab reports
        and process mass fragments present in biological samples, which
        is widely applied for non-target analysis of metabolites. Doing
        so, Metab considerably speed up the data mining process in
        metabolomics and produces better quality results. Metab was
        developed using interactive features, allowing users with lack
        of R knowledge to appreciate its functio-nalities.
