Metab-package           What the package does (short line)
biomass.example         An example of the biomass data frame to be used
                        in conjunction with the function norm.biomass.
clean.fix               A function for cleaning and correct results
                        obtained with the Automated Mass Spectral
                        Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS)
                        coupled to our in-house library.
clean.fix.results       An example of the results obtained using the
                        function clean.fix.
del.false               del.false: a function to exclude false
                        positives from metabolomics data frames.
htest                   Function developed to apply t-test or ANOVA on
                        a data frame.
norm.biomass            A function to normalize metabolomics data by
                        the biomass, cell number or O.D.
norm.internal           Normalize metabolomics data sets by internal
                        standard
norm.medium             A function to normalize metabolomics data by
                        the uncultured medium.
raw.peaks               A function to extract mass fragments from
                        metabolomics data sets.
raw.peaks.results       An example of the data frame produced by
                        raw.peaks.
ref.ion.lib             The reference ion library to be used in
                        conjunction with the function clean.fix.
